Source code for my fox ears project. I wear fox ears pretty much all the time because they're so cool! I recently made some new ones with LEDs in which can be lit up for raves and stuff. This is the source code which drives those LEDs from a digispark in my pocket. It should run fine on other arduinos and arduino compatible wearable tiny computers.

They run straight off a rechargable 9v battery and gets a bit extra battery life by having the digispark set to the 8mhz mode, which you'll find as an option in the Boards menu of the soon to be released next version of the Digispark Arduino app!

Adafruit's florapixels are super cool because they only need one data wire, and you don't have to keep pulsing them when you aren't changing their colours like you do with most other addressable led pixels. Seeing as they only need one wire you can plug them together with regular stereo audio jacks which are rugged, plentiful, aethetic, and you can get splitters and other sorts of odd connectors easily ^_^

They run for about 4 hours on one 9v battery at about 70% lighting intensity (strobing), so keep a spare battery to make it through the whole rave
